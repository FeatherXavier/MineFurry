导言
大多数软件授权声明是设计用以剥夺您共享与修改软件的自由。相反地，GNU通用公共授权力图保证您分享与修改自由软件的自由-确保软件对所有的使用者都是自由的。通用公共授权适用于大多数自由软件基金会的软件，以及任何作者指定使用本授权的其他软件。（有些自由软件基金会的软件，则适用GNU函式库通用公共授权规定。）您也可以让您的软件适用本授权规定。

当我们在谈论自由软件时，我们所指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共授权是设计用以确保使您拥有发布自由软件备份的自由（以及您可以决定此一服务是否收费），确保您能收到源码或者在您需要时能得到它，确保您能变更软件或将它的一部分用于新的自由软件；并且确保您知道您可以做上述的这些事情。

为了保障您的权利，我们需要作出限制：禁止任何人否认您上述的权利，或者要求您放弃这些权利。如果您发布软件的副本，或者对之加以修改，这些限制就转化成为您的责任。

例如，假如您发布此类程序的副本，无论是免费或收取费用，您必须将您所享有的一切权利给予收受者。您也必须确保他们也能收到或得到原始程序码。而且您必须向他们展示这些条款的內容，使他们知到他们所享有的权利。

我们采取两项措施來保护您的权利：(1)以著作权保护软件，以及(2)提供您本授权，赋与您复制、发布并且／或者修改软件的法律许可。

同时，为了保护作者与我们（按：指自由软件基金会），我们想要确定每个人都明白，自由软件是沒有担保责任的。如果软件被他人修改并加以传播，我们需要其收受者知道，他们所得到的并非原始版本，因此由他人所引出的任何问题对原作者的声誉将不会有任何的影响。

最后，所有自由软件不断地受到软件专利的威胁。我们希望能避免自由软件的再发布者以个人名义取得专利授权而使程序专有化的风险。为了防止上述的情事发生，我们在此明确声明：任何专利都必须为了每个人的自由使用而核准，否则就不应授与专利。


以下是有关复制、发布及修改的明确条款及条件
复制、发布与修改的条款与条件

0. 凡著作权人在其程序或其他著作中声明，该程序或著作会在通用公共授权条款下发布，本授权对其均有适用。以下所称的"程序"，是指任何一种适用通用公共授权的程序或著作；并且一个"基于本程序的著作"，则指本程序或任何基于著作权法所产生的衍生著作，换言之，是指包含本程序全部或一部的著作，不论是完整的或经过修改的程序，以及（或）翻译成其他语言的程序（以下"修改"一词包括但不限于翻译行为在內）。被授权人则称为"您"。

本授权不适用于复制、发布与修改以外的行为；这些行为不在本授权范围内。执行本程序的行为并不受限制，而本程序的输出只有在其內容构成基于本程序所生的著作（而非只是因为执行本程序所造成）时，始受本授权拘束。至于程序的输出內容是否构成本程序的衍生著作，则取决于本程序的具体用途。

1. 您可以对所收受的本程序源代码，无论以何种媒介，复制与发布其完整的复制物，然而您必须符合以下要件：以显著及适当的方式在每一份复制物上发布适当的著作权标示及无担保声明；维持所有有关本授权以及无担保声明的原貌；并将本授权的副本连同本程序一起交付予其他任何一位本程序的收受者。

您可以对让与复制物的实际行为收取一定的费用，您也可以自由决定是否提供担保以作为对价的交换。

2. 您可以修改本程序的一个或数个复制物或者本程序的任何部份，以此形成基于本程序所生的著作，并依前述第一条规定，复制与发布此一修改过的程序或著作，但您必须符合以下要件：

(a) 您必须在所修改的挡案上附加显著的标示，阐明您修改过这些挡案，以及修改日期。

(b) 您必须就您所发布或发行的著作，无论是包含本程序全部或一部的著作，或者是自本程序或其任何部份所衍生的著作，整体授权所有第三人依本授权规定使用，且不得因此项授权行为而收取任何费用。

(c) 若经过修改的程序在执行时通常以交互方式读取命令时，您必须在最常被使用的方式下，于开始进入这种交互式使用时，列印或展示以下宣告：适当的著作权标示及无担保声明（或者声明您提供担保）、使用者可以依这些条件再发布此程序，以及告知使用者如何浏览本授权的副本。（例外：若本程序本身是以交互的方式执行，然而通常却不会列印该宣告时，则您基于本程序所生的著作便无需列印该宣告。）

这些要求对修改过的著作是整体适用的。倘著作中可识別的一部份并非衍生自本程序，并且可以合理地认为是一独立的、个別的著作，则当您将其作为个別著作加以发布时，本授权及其条款将不适用于该部分。然而当您将上述部分，作为基于本程序所生著作的一部而发布时，整个著作的发布必须符合本授权条款的规定，而本授权对于其他被授权人所为的许可及于著作整体。

因此，本条规定的意图不在于主张或剥夺您对于完全由您所完成著作的权利；应该說，本条规定意在行使对基于程序所生的之衍生著作或集合著作发布行为的控制权。

此外，非基于本程序所生的其他著作与本程序（或基于本程序所生的著作）在同一储存或发布的媒介上的单纯聚集行为，并不会使该著作因此受本授权条款约束。

3. 您可以依前述第一、二条规定，复制与发布本程序（或第二条所述基于本程序所产生的著作）的目的码或可执行形式，但您必须符合以下要件：

(a) 附上完整、相对应的机器可判读源码，而这些源码必须依前述第一、二条规定在经常用以作为软件交换的媒介物上发布；或

(b) 附上至少三年有效的书面报价文件，提供任何第三人在支付不超过实际发布源码所需成本的费用下，取得相同源码的完整机器可读复制物，并依前述第一、二条规定在经常用以作为软件交换的媒介物上发布该复制物；或

(c) 附上您所收受有关发布相同源码的报价资讯。（本项选择仅在非赢利发布、且仅在您依前述b项方式自该书面报价文件收受程序目的码或可执行形式时，始有适用。）

著作的源码，是指对著作进行修改时适用的形式。对于一个可执行的著作而言，完整的源码是指著作中所包含所有模组的全部源码，加上相关介面的定义挡，还加上用以控制该著作编译与安裝的描述。然而，特別的例外情况是，所发布的源码并不需包含任何通常会随著所执行作业系统的主要组成部分（编译器、核心等等）而发布的软件（无论以源码或二进位格式），除非该部分本身即附加在可执行程序中。

若可执行码或目的码的发布方式，是以指定的地点提供存取位置供人复制，则提供可自相同地点复制源码的使用机会，视同对于源码的发布，然而第三人并不因此而负有将目的码连同源码一起复制的义务。

4. 除本授权所明示的方式外，您不得对本程序加以复制、修改、再授权或发布。任何试图以其他方式进行复制、修改、再授权或者发布本程序的行为均为无效，并且将自动终止您基于本授权所得享有的权利。然而，依本授权规定自您手中收受复制物或权利之人，只要遵守本授权规定，他们所获得的授权并不会因此终止。

5. 因为您并未在本授权上签名，所以您无须接受本授权。然而，除此之外您別无其他修改或发布本程序或其衍生著作的授权许可。若您不接受本授权，则这些行为在法律上都是被禁止的。因此，藉由对本程序（或任何基于本程序所生的著作）的修改或发布行为，您表示了对于本授权的接受，以及接受所有关于复制、发布或修改本程序或基于本程序所生著作的条款与条件。

6. 每当您再发布本程序（或任何基于本程序所生的著作）时，收受者即自动获得原授权人所授予依本授权条款与条件复制、发布或修改本程序的权利。您不得就本授权所赋予收受者行使的权利附加任何进一步的限制。您对于第三人是否履行本授权一事，无须负责。

7. 若法院判决、专利侵权主张或者其他任何理由（不限于专利争议）的结果，使得加诸于您的条件（无论是由法院命令、协议书或其他方式造成）与本授权规定有所冲突，他们并不免除您对于本授权规定的遵守。若您无法同时符合依本授权所生义务及其他相关义务而进行发布，那么其结果便是您不得发布该程序。例如，若专利授权不允许其他人直接或间接取得复制物，通过您以免付权利金的方式再发布该程序，您唯一能同时滿足该义务及本授权的方式就是徹底避免进行该程序的发布。

若本条任一部份在特殊情况下被认定无效或无法执行时，本条其余部分仍应适用，且本条全部于其他情况下仍应适用。

本条的目的并不在诱使您侵害专利或其他財产权的权利主张，或就此类主张的有效性加以争执；本条的唯一目的，是在保障藉由公共授权惯例所执行自由软件发布系统的完整性。许多人信赖该系统一贯使用的应用程序，而对经由此系统发布的大量软件有相当多的贡献；作者／贡献者有权决定他或她是否希望经由其他的系统发布软件，而被授权人则无该种选择权。

本条的用意在于将本授权其他不确定的部分徹底解释清楚。

8. 若因为专利或享有著作权保护的介面问题，而使得本程序的发布与／或使用局限于某些国家时，则将本程序置于本授权规范之下的原著作权人得增列明确的发布地区限制条款，将这些国家排除在外，而使发布的许可只限在未受排除的国家之內或之中。在该等情况下，该限制条款如同以书面方式订定于本授权內容中，而成为本授权的条款。

9. 自由软件基金会得随时发表通用公共授权的修正版与／或新版本。新版本在精神上将近似于目前的版本，然而在细节上或所不同以因应新的问题或状况。

每一个版本都有个別的版本号码。若本程序指定有授权版本号码，表示其适用该版本或是"任何新版本"时，您可以选择遵循该版本或任何由自由软件基金会日后所发表新版本的条款与条件。若本程序并未指定授权版本号码时，您可以选择任一自由软件基金会所发表的版本。

10. 若您想将部分本程序纳入其他自由程序，而其发布的条件有所不同时，请写信取得作者的许可。若为自由软件基金会享有著作权的软件，请写信至自由软件基金会；我们有时会以例外方式予以处理。我们的决定取决于两项目标：确保我们自由软件的所有衍生著作均维持在自由的状态，并广泛地促进软件的分享与再利用。

无担保声明

11. 由于本程序是无偿授权，因此在法律许可范围內，本授权对本程序并不负担保责任。非经书面声明，著作权人与／或其他提供程序之人，无论明示或默许，均是依「现况」提供本程序而并无任何形式的担保责任，其包括但不限于，就适售性以及特定目的的适用性为默示性担保。有关本程序品质与效能的全部风险均由您承担。如本程序被证明有瑕疵，您应承担所有服务、修复或改正的费用。

12. 非经法律要求或书面同意，任何著作权人或任何可能依前述方式修改与／或发布本程序者，对于您因为使用或不能使用本程序所造成的一般性、特殊性、意外性或间接性损失，不负任何责任（包括但不限于，资料损失，资料执行不精确，或应由您或第三人承担的损失，或本程序无法与其他程序运作等），即便前述的著作权人或其他人已被告知该等损失的可能性时，也是一样。

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS-
